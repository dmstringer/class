	<h1>My Dachshunds</h1>
    <img src="images/my-dachshunds.jpg" alt="a picture of my three dachshunds">
	<p>Well, I need a topic for my test website so how about my dachshunds?</p>
	<p>From the picture, left to right, are my three girls:</p>	
	<ul> 
		<li>Suki</li>
		<li>Sonya</li>
		<li>Sadie</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I have been a life-long lover of Dachshunds, same as my late wife (she's in the second picture above), and will always have one or more.</p>
	<p>If you're interested in the breed, or are just looking to add another sausage dog to your family, please consider adopting instead of buying from a puppy mill.</p>
	<p>A local Houston organization that can help with that is <a href="http://dreamdachs.org/">DREAM Dachshund Rescue</a>.</p>
