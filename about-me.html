	<h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="a picture of my ugly mug">
	<p>Hello, my name is Scott. I'm 48 years old and have lived in the Houston area almost all my life.
		I wasn't born in Texas, but I tried to get here as soon as possible.  
		Well, ok, my dad (in the Air Force at the time) was transferred to Houston when I was 2. 
		But I've been enjoying it ever since.</p>
	<p>Currently I'm working as a Inventory Control Analyst for Tenaris, but have decided I want different/better things for my career. 
		I guess you could call me your typical middle-aged "career changer".</p>	
	<p>And I am more than ready to jump into this new adventure!</p>
	<p>Yeah, so if you're tired of the boring stuff about me, you can go back and look at my <a href="index.html">Dachshunds</a>.</p>
